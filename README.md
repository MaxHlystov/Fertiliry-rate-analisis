# Fertiliry rate analisis
The capstone project for "[Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics/home/welcome)" course on coursera.org
  
  The data for the file "fertilityAndEconomic_shrink.csv" was got from the [UNESCO Institute for Statistic's site](http://data.uis.unesco.org/) “Demographic and socio-economic” section.

**Executive summary:** The work analyzes the influence of the quality of life on the fertility rate. It is shown that an increase in the quality of living reduces the birth rate with a 60% probability. A model has been created that makes it possible to estimate the level of fertility according to the main socio-economic indicators of the country.
